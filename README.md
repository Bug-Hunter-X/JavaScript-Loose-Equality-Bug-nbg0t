# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to loose equality (==) comparisons.  The provided code attempts to differentiate between null, undefined, and other values; however, due to the nature of loose equality, it fails to correctly identify certain falsy values such as 0, empty strings, and false.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the use of loose equality (==).  Loose equality performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing values across different types. For example, 0 == false evaluates to true, while 0 === false evaluates to false (strict equality).

## Solution

The solution uses strict equality (===) to eliminate type coercion and ensure accurate comparisons. This approach provides more reliable and predictable behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code.
3. Run the code using a JavaScript interpreter (Node.js, browser's console, etc.). Observe the unexpected outputs.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code using strict equality.
5. Run the corrected code to see the expected outputs.
